## Inspect or load locally

Open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked**, and select this folder. The manifest lists the requested permissions and supported sites. Review those permissions before use with a game account.

The original extension manifest uses the name Travian CP Predictor. Predictions depend on observed production and the configured celebrations.

This is a source snapshot of a personal extension. No live game interactions were performed while assembling this portfolio. Original application code is preserved.

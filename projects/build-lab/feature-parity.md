The recovered client tuning supersedes the earlier sampled cap and token approximations. Dependencies now use the recovered Locker Codes client table (now `src/engine/linked-attributes.json`), including the 81-inch Close Shot → Post Control delta of 45. This matches the supplied in-game 87 Mid-Range / 77 Close Shot / 42 Post Control spread. Imports preserve original ratings, surface linked-rule conflicts and offer reconciliation.

## Missing source

The remaining confirmed gaps are some animation size/season gates and any future live-tuning changes. The game manifest points to packed assets, not a recovered rules table.

Supplemental source: https://github.com/lightmatmul/nba2k27-builder-dataset at 18f692eaaa611e6daf9427a3d5a5f97ae0423bba. Extraction: `research/downloaded-page.json`. Readable values: `research/downloaded-build-report.md`.

Attribute locks: all 21 rows have persistent lock toggles and gold labels/ratings. Direct edits are disabled, linked edits and body changes that move a locked rating are rejected, and unlocking restores normal editing.
